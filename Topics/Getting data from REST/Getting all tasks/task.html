<p>Currently, we have a controller with a list of tasks, but there is no endpoint that allows us to access them. Your task is to implement the following endpoint:</p>

<p><code class="language-json">GET /tasks/all</code> â€“ returns all tasks as an array of JSON objects. In case of success, the server should respond with <code class="language-json">200 (OK)</code> status code.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:<strong> </strong>Response for a <code class="language-json">GET /tasks/all</code> request:</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">[
